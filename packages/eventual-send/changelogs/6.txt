implement updated `HandledPromise` interface:
  * use `new HandledPromise(...args)` instead of `Promise.makeHandled(...args)`
  * use `HandledPromise.resolve(x)` (exported also as `E.resolve(x)`) which
    returns x if it is already a HandledPromise or Promise, or x's corresponding
    HandledPromise, or a new HandledPromise
  * the promise handler now uses `get` instead of `GET` and `applyMethod` instead of `POST`
  * delete, has, and set traps and their corresponding `E` operations have been removed as per the spec
  * the `E.C` experimental "eventual chain" proxy has been removed
