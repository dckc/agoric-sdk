# ERTP - Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol

Bitcoin has unspent transactions. Ethereum has account balances. Agoric
has ERTP. 

ERTP is a uniform way of transferring tokens and other digital
assets in JavaScript. All kinds of digital assets can be easily
created, but importantly, they can be transferred in exactly the same
ways, with exactly the same security properties.
